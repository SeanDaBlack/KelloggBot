# Setup

On mac/pc:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install `webdriver-manager` to automatically download the correct chrome driver. If you are having issues opening having it open chrome, check https://github.com/SergeyPirogov/webdriver_manager.

Poppler must be installed for pdf2image. Follow the instructions at https://pdf2image.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html to install.

You will also need to install ffmpeg if it is not already installed: [Mac installation guide](https://superuser.com/a/624562) [Windows installation guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows)

LaTeX must also be installed for resume generation. If you're unsure where to start with that, follow the [official instructions](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). (Mac users: I'd recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install [BasicTex](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/basictex#default).)

`python main.py` to run. It will loop until you kill the job. `ctrl + c` in your terminal to give HR a break (optional).

Mac:

You might also get a trust issue with the downloaded driver being unverified. To fix that, run 

`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine chromedriver`

this just tells the OS it's safe to use this driver, and Selenium will start working. See https://timonweb.com/misc/fixing-error-chromedriver-cannot-be-opened-because-the-developer-cannot-be-verified-unable-to-launch-the-chrome-browser-on-mac-os/ for more info.
